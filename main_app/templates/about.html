  Horse breeders produce and sell horses for a variety of purposes such as racing,
  showing, and pleasure riding.
</small>

<h3>Duties</h3>
<p>
  Successful horse breeders are well versed in equine reproduction, behavior,
  and management. The duties of a horse breeder may include such responsibilities
  as facilitating breedings by live cover or artificial insemination, handling
  stallions, teasing mares, attending foalings, assisting with veterinary exams,
  keeping herd health records, and managing farm staff such as broodmare managers,
  stallion managers, and grooms. Horse breeders in the Thoroughbred industry are
  only allowed to conduct live cover breedings due to restrictions imposed by the
  Jockey Club. 
</p>
<p>
  Breeders working with other types of horses may need to develop
  proficiency with advanced reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination
  and embryo transfer or employ individuals who have skill in such areas.
  Breeders must work closely with equine veterinarians, nutritionists, farriers, and
  other industry professionals to provide complete care for the horses under their
  supervision. Small breeders may be required to work long hours in varying weather
  conditions and extreme temperatures, assisting with routine mucking and feeding duties.
</p>
<p>
  Breeders who own larger farms (and have a staff to handle the daily care of the horses)
  may not have the same responsibilities. Breeders may also be involved with showing their
  stock in a variety of judged breed shows and competitive events to demonstrate their
  quality and enhance the value of related breeding stock. Proven race and show stallions
  command high prices when they stand at stud, so it is to the breederâ€™s benefit to give
  their horses every chance to prove themselves in their area of sport.
</p>

<h3>Career Options</h3>
<p>
  Horse breeders tend to specialize by focusing on the production of a single breed that
  interests them. Thoroughbreds, Arabians, and American Quarter Horses tend to be the most
  popular choices for breeding operations, though Warmbloods are becoming increasingly
  popular. Some breeders also specialize in producing and marketing horses for a specific
  purpose, such one intended for racing or show jumping.
</p>

<h3>Education & Training</h3>
<p>
  While no specific degree or training is required to begin a career as a horse breeder, many
  in the industry do have a college degree in a field such as Animal Science, Equine Science,
  Equine Reproduction, or a related area. Schools such as U.C. Davis and Colorado State are
  known for having some of the top programs in the field of equine reproduction. Coursework
  for these animal science related degrees generally includes the study of subjects such as
  anatomy, physiology, reproduction, genetics, nutrition, and behavior. 
</p>
<p>
  Courses in marketing, communication, and technology are usually beneficial, as many horse breeders 
  create their own advertising and web pages to promote their breeding program. Most horse breeders have
  significant experience in the industry before they start their own breeding farm. Many start
  out as grooms or assistants and then rise to the management level before striking out on their
  own. There is no substitute for hands-on experience in the horse industry. Additionally,
  breeders must be familiar with the history and characteristics of the breed they intend to
  produce. Studying pedigrees and learning how to evaluate conformation are of particular importance.
